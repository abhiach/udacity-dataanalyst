## Summary of Findings

>  In the exploration, 
I found that there was a strong relationship between the ArrDelay and DepDelay .
I noticed the weak relationship between DelayElapsedTime and ArrDelay/DepDelay.
Long distance flights have less ArrDelay and DepDelay.
Arrival delay was more on Sunday and Saturday compare to other days.
Flights are usually less delayed in the month of September.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the various reasons behind the flight delay.
and left intermediate derivations. I started by introducing the
different categorical variables which provides information about flight delay.
I used the line plot to display the delay reasons. 
Afterwards,I presented the distribution of Arrival delay to show the delay of flights.
I also wanted to show the average departure delay of different Airlines. To present this I used the bar plot.
At the end I was Interested to know which US airport is the best airport in terms of Arrival dealy.
Using heatmap I presented the information about Average Arrival delay in different Airports.
